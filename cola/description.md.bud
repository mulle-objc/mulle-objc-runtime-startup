This static library provides the required `__register_mulle_objc_universe`
function for executables, that link against
[mulle-objc-runtime](//github.com/mulle-objc/mulle-objc-runtime)
only.

Use this library, if you want to create executables, that only
require the [mulle-objc-runtime](//github.com/mulle-objc/mulle-objc-runtime)
and nothing else. Most projects will link against
[MulleObjC](//github.com/mulle-objc/MulleObjC) or the MulleFoundation
though, and will use the startup libraries.
